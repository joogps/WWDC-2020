# //dash
#### A game for the skilled

//dash _(pronounced 'slash-slash-dash')_ is a _shoot 'em up_ game with simple, well designed graphics and blazing fast action. It makes use of the Force Touch trackpad like no other of its kind, so, to enjoy it at most, you'll need one of those. Also, make sure that "Force click and haptic feedback" (under `System Preferences > Trackpad`) is enabled on your machine. Also, please resize your window until all content can be seen. This playground uses sound, so turn your volume up, and good luck!

## Bitty
![Bitty](images/markup-bitty.png)
This is Bitty. He's the good guy, and you control him. He also blinks a lot. His goal is to defeat the bad guys (his enemies) and nothing else. The more enemies he gets to defeat, the more points you get. To move him, you can either point your mouse to where you want him to aim or use WASD (or even the arrow keys if you prefer). To dash, press W or the up arrow. In order to shoot, you can either press the spacebar or simply click with your mouse. If you find yourself trapped, you can make a super shot, which can hit all of the enemies on its way. To do so, you need to hold the spacebar for one second or do a Force Click on your trackpad. Please note that both shots have cooldowns, so use them wisely.

## Enemies

There are three types of enemies: the regular ones, the strong ones, and the smart ones. All of them appear randomly, with frequencies that increase progressively (every 15 points), and having them to hit you ends the game. The regular ones follow Bitty, and that's their only skill. The strong enemies need multiple shots to explode, since they can have up to two extra layers of protection. The smart enemies have an eye and, thus, can see. Because of that, they can also shoot Bitty, with projectiles that can't be destroyed in any way, so you _need_ to dodge them. Strong enemies can be combined with smart enemies.

## Power-ups

As the game gets harder, you might need some external help. That help can be given in the form of power-ups, which can do two things: make Bitty stronger, giving him an extra chance after he's hit (strength power-up), or slow down the time for enemies so it's easier to explode them (slow motion power-up). Power-ups are not cumulative.
